Following the success of the <a href="watch.html">Watch</a>, Co Ltd. developed the system to function much more like a typical console, having cartridges to run the games. There was widespread commercial success up until the release of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> in 1989.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[1]</a></sup>
			<br>
			<h1><u>Development</u></h1>
			&emsp;The focus of this console was to design a handheld version of consoles that would function like a home console. The console was developed by the same team that was in charge of the development of the Watch.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[2]</a></sup><br>
			&emsp;The codename for the project was "Project Future." Its goal was to be revolutionary technology for its time, allowing a much more advanced experience than previous portable devices. It contained 16kb of RAM and 16kb of VRAM, and had an FSTN LCD display.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[4]</a></sup><br>
			&emsp;Advertisement was a major focus of Co Ltd. at the time and they aimed to have advertisements play on most major TV brodcasting stations. It was widely accepted to be one of the most successful marketing campaigns of the eighties.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[4]</a></sup>
			<br>
			<h1><u>Nintendo v Co Ltd. Legal Battle</u></h1>
			&emsp;After the release of the game boy in 1989, Nintendo seeked to shut down Co Ltd. in order to push their console onto the market and destroy competition. Nintendo's legal defense saw much success in this. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(attorney)">John Kirby</a>, a member of the prosecution, said that "I will kill you. I will kill you so hard. No one will remember your stupid little game system."<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[5]</a></sup><br>
			&emsp;Co Ltd. shut down shortly after this case. When asked about Game and Co Ltd., 99.5% of buyers could not recall ever purchasing such a system.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[6]</a></sup> Few games are left for purchase on sites like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay">eBay</a>. Most Game games can be played on a Game Boy.
