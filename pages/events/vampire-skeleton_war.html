			<div class="paragraphs">&emsp;The Vampire-Skeleton war was a conflict between two major parties and their alliances: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire">Vampires</a>, originating in Transylvania, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(undead)">Skeletons</a>, originating in various graveyards worldwide, going from January 1432 until October 1434. The Vampire-Skeleton war resulted in the deaths of over 3 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human">humans</a> as well as around 500 thousand skeletons and 300 thousand vampires.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[1]</a></sup> Combat primarily took place in locations such as strange open plains, deep forest, mysterious abandoned structures, and caves.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[2]</a></sup> This is a highly notable war in the cultures of skeletons and vampires, due to the extremely high levels of casualties brought unto human civilizations as both sides forcibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death">recruited</a> soldiers.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[3]</a></sup>
			  <br>
				<h2><u>Causes</u></h2>
				&emsp;On December 31, 1431, at 11:59pm, during the annual beginning-of-year Skeleton-Vampire meetup, famous Skeleton Bartholomew Vanderbilt III made a joke in poor taste to famous Vampire Draven Shadowmere IV, asking if he's "sunk his teeth" into the new market, Skelecoin. Despite its name, this was not a cryptocurrency, but in fact a coin made of <a href="../items/mycketransigium">mycketransigium</a>. Shadowmere IV shot Vanderbilt III with one of the first prototypes of a sawed-off 12-gauge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun">shotgun</a>. Despite numerous efforts, Vanderbilt III's body would not piece back together, killing him. As the clock struck midnight, Skeleton Lord Mr. Skelly Bones was said to have yelled out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula">Vampire Count Dracula</a>, "I HATE YOU! I HATE VAMPIRES! I OFFICIALLY DECLARE WAR ON YOU STUPID UGLY MORONS!!!!!" <br><sup><a href="../real_sources">[4]</a></sup>
				<h2><u>Early Stages of Conflict</u></h2>
				&emsp;According to numerous sources, fighting broke out almost immediately after the declaration of war. However, they failed to consider that both skeletons and vampires are generally unkillable by normal methods. In the location of the initial conflict, there was no access to the typical means of killing each other, so no deaths were caused because of this conflict.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[5]</a></sup> However, after fighting died down, one vampire was killed after eating a stick he found laying on the ground, reportedly having said that "that stick looks yummy yummy." This stick was actually carved into a makeshift wooden stake made by a skeleton attempting to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_weapon">improvised weaponry</a>. Contrary to what was believed at the time, the stick did not kill him, as it would not have counted as a wooden stake, which is now known by verified <a href="../people/historians">omegatea Historians</a>. The actual cause of death was unknown, but it is assumed that because eating a stick off the ground was such a poor move given the circumstances that a higher power took their life out of anger.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[6]</a></sup></div>

			<h2><u>Industrial Warfare</u></h2>
			&emsp;Due to the advanced level of technology at the time, Skeletons and Vampires both developed a very strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex">military-industrial complex</a>.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[7]</a></sup> Vampires produced large amounts of obsidian blades, the only known way of killing Skeletons, while Skeletons mass-produced wooden stakes at a similar pace.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="../real_sources">[9]</a></sup> As a result, both economies were heavily boosted, causing many political and economical leaders to invest in the war and the mass-production of weaponry. Consequently, this led to the extension of the war due to agreements made by large stockholders, despite being uninvolved in the initial or ongoing conflict.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[10]</a></sup><br>
			<h2><u>Recruitment</u></h2>
			&emsp;As the war was composed of two sides of undead populations, recruitment methods ranged from typical door-to-door advertisements to recruitment by death. As the war began, neither side would forcibly recruit members, instead going between houses in large towns and villages asking to enlist in their side of the war (and become either a skeleton or vampire for the rest of their life.) Due to the large amount of benefits provided by each side of the war, peasant populations were a common target for recruitment, as they would often join for the free housing and food provided in the offer. However, as warfare went on, both sides began getting more desperate, so they began forcefully recruiting humans into their armies, going after criminals and other evildoers. Eventually, innocents would undergo these recruitment efforts, including many who tried to fight back against this. Among these innocents was <a href="../people/omegatea">omegatea</a>, who was turned into a vampire at some point in late 1432, who at the time was reportedly having lunch with an unknown neighbor.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="../real_sources">[11]</a></sup><sup><a href="../real_sources">[12]</a></sup>

			<h2><u>Parisian Vampire Raid of 1433</u></h2>
			&emsp;The Parisian Vampire Raid of 1433 (Le Raid des Vampires sur Paris de 1433) was a raid on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris, France</a> from the side of the Vampires, taking place on February 14th, 1433. This attack was primarily due to the large number of civilians living in Paris at the time, as it could have provided enough recruitments to lead to a full victory from the vampires.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[13]</a></sup> omegatea, now a vampire, was one of the most valuable members on the side of the vampires during this conflict, managing to get upwards of 200 recruitments during the singular attack. This is cited as the most likely cause of the <a href="../events/treaty_of_paris_2024">hatred of omegatea by the French</a>, as it was a devastating day for the France fandom. However, <a href="../people/omegatea">omegatea unfortunately was killed</a> before the raid ended.<sup><font class="teal">(or fortunately if you're Parisian omegalul)</font> <a href="../people/omegatea">[14]</a></sup><br>
			<h2><u>Surrender and Victory</u></h2>
			&emsp;Unfortunately for the Vampires, they failed to consider that recruiting thousands of Frenchmen might actually be a terrible decision for their army. Now making up a large portion of the army, the French had the Vampires surrender on October 12, 1434, ending the conflict with a ceasefire. A peace treaty was signed, officially marking the end of the war.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[15]</a></sup>
