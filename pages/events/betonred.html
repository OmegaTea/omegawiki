		  <div class="paragraphs">&emsp;The 1982 Gambling Incident, more commonly referred to as "Always Bet on Red" or the "Always Bet on Red Incident" was a series of gambling plays that lead to the bankruptcy of <a href="../people/omegatea.html">omegatea</a> in their second life.
			<br>
			<h2><u>Background</u></h2>
			&emsp;On March 14, 1982, omegatea took a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate the anniversary of their revival on the 17th.<sup><a href="../people/omegatea.html">[1]</a></sup> After arriving in Vegas, they stayed at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicana_Las_Vegas">Tropicana Las Vegas</a>, planning 7 night's worth of stay. They would frequent blackjack and poker, but found little to no success. They did, however, manage to turn a profit betting on pool.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[2]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;Until the 17th, they generally avoided betting on roulette, stating that it was "too far based in luck" and "completely removed from skill". However, after some pressure from friends, they would end up gambling on roulette.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[3]</a></sup> 
			<h2><u>The Incident</u></h2>
			&emsp;Due to miscalculation on omegatea's part, they ended up accidentally gambling their entire life's savings on one game of roulette. They reportedly did not notice "until the ball was already in motion."<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[4]</a></sup> Having bet on red, however, the play fortunately was successful as the ball landed in the red "12" slot.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[4]</a></sup> After several more plays, omegatea had doubled their money by eight times the original value, reaching upwards of 6.3 million USD (equivalent to approx. 20.6 million USD in 2024).<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[5]</a></sup> Taking notice of this, associates of the Tropicana and members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_crime_family">Kansas City crime family</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia">Mafia</a> decided to challenge omegatea to a final gamble of all of omegatea's money, as well as an additional million dollars added on.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[6]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;omegatea decided to take a risk with the gamble, and put the money into black this time. However, the ball landed in the red "9", forcing omegatea into a debt to the family of one million dollars.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[7]</a></sup>

			<h2><u>Mafia Conditions</u></h2>
			&emsp;Due to a rivalry with a casino nearby, the family gave omegatea a million dollars, stating that they would remove the debt from omegatea's name once they had doubled it purely with gambling at the rival casino. The conditions are believed to be as follows:<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[8]</a></sup>
			<br>&emsp;• omegatea could not earn money from any means other than gambling at the rival casino.
			<br>&emsp;• omegatea could not spend any money from gambling other than to pay off the debt.
			<br>&emsp;• omegatea would get one meal a day from the casino until the debt was paid off.
			<br>&emsp;• The debt would be considered paid off once the Mafia members were paid back the one million loaned as well as an additional one million earned from gambling at the rival casino.
			<br>&emsp;However, due to a loophole in the contract, omegatea was able to quickly declare bankruptcy, being freed of the debt and therefore the conditions alongside it. This came at the cost of tensions between the Kansas City crime family and omegatea.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[9]</a></sup>
			<h2><u>Death of omegatea</u></h2>
			&emsp;It has been confirmed that certain members of the family had made payments towards the Russian government group known as the Diamonds in their <a href="../people/omegatea_assassination_attempts.html">mission to kill omegatea</a>. It is estimated that around 15 million dollars were invested into the cause from these members alone.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[10]</a></sup>
