			<h2 id="early"><u>Early Childhood</u></h2>
			&emsp;Not much is known about the beginnings of their first two lives. Their first birthday is assumed to have been on either June 16 or April 28, though no date has been confirmed. It is believed that from a young age in their first life they became relatively close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Jesus of Nazareth</a> (who at the time was known as <span lang="he" dir="rtl">ישוע</span>).<sup><a href="../real_sources">[4]</a></sup> They have been confirmed to have no appearances in the bible, despite the connection with Jesus.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[5]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;Their second birthday is assumed to be on March 17, being "born" around 1500 AD, though revived from their old life due to their existence as a vampire.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[6]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;Their third birthday is on July 31.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[7]</a></sup> Having used the revival token, they were reborn as another person into their current life. They attended schooling through high school, which they are currently in. From a very young age, they had the blanket dog <a href="../items/bluey">Bluey</a> which they carried around with them often. They are currently friends with <a href="coffeeboi">CoffeeBoi</a> and <a href="ch0nks">ch0nks</a>.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[8]</a></sup>
			<br>
			<h2 id="persona"><u>Personal life</u></h2>
			&emsp;At some point in the year 37 AD, omegatea came into contact with a group of vampires while travelling to europe using the <a href="../items/steam_wings">steam wings</a>. This left them as a vampire themselves, able to avoid most circumstances that would cause death. Contrary to popular belief, vampires do not burn in sunlight, though they get sunburned more easily and tend to avoid bright areas.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[9]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;During the <a href="../events/vampire-skeleton_war">1400s Vampire-Skeleton War</a>, they were killed by a skeleton using a wooden stake. They revived about 30 years later, though no longer a vampire.
			<br>
			&emsp;In the late 1500s, they obtained the <a href="../items/revival_token">Revival Token</a> in the <a href="../events/revival_token_quest">Revival Token Fetch Quest</a>.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[10]</a></sup> This allowed them to avoid death from old age as long as they had the token, and, upon death, revive and use the token.
			<br>
			&emsp;In 1998, omegatea was <a href="omegatea_assassination_attempts">killed by the Diamonds</a>, reviving years later. They now spend most of their time playing video games and series such as <a href="../items/peak">Animal Crossing</a>, <a href="../items/peak">Persona</a>, and <a href="../items/peak">Project Moon</a>. I'll probably add more stuff here idk pretend theres more colon three
