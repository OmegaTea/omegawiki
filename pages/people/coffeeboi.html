			&emsp;CoffeeBoi (Real name ████████ █████ ██████<sup><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/">[1]</a></sup>) is a famous web designer and color theory expert. Believe it or not, he actually chose the colors for this page himself. Originally believed to be British, it has been confirmed that he is in fact American.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[2]</a></sup>
			<br>
			<h2><u>Early Childhood</u></h2>
			&emsp;CoffeBoi's earliest memory is at 2 years old, finishing the construction of the exterior of the Burj Khalifa. There was an incident during construction where he fell off but got caught by a really big bird. The bird turned out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bird">Big Bird</a>, famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street">Sesame Street</a> character.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[3]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;As an elementary schooler, CoffeeBoi took the infamous "Young 'CoffeeBoi' PNG" photo. That same year, he ended up becoming friends with <a href="gbin.html">gbin</a>, after parachuting down to him from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_Proteus">Model 281 Proteus</a>, which he had set to crash into the school building below. After gbin critiqued his form, they later ended up crashing another into the abandoned right wing of the school.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[4]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;His middle school memories before the eighth grade have been completely wiped, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19</a> hitting a vital nerve in the memory of those years.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[5]</a></sup> In the eighth grade, CoffeeBoi (at the time known as BritainBoi) met <a href="omegatea.html">omegatea</a>, conversing for the first time after several months of beating omegatea to a pulp after spanish class.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[6]</a></sup>
			<h2><u>High School and Drug Addiction</u></h2>
			&emsp;Near the beginning of high school, CoffeeBoi began getting immensely addicted to the Schedule I drug known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello">Cello</a>. He had a short burst of addiction to Coffee, but after going through intense rehab sessions, he has managed to bring it down to a level of casual enjoyment.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[7]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;CoffeeBoi's high school career could be described with the phrase "fell off", since he did literally nothing throught the entirety of his high school career.
			<br>
			&emsp;CoffeeBoi graduated High School with a 1.0 gpa.<sup><a href="../real_sources.html">[8]</a></sup>
