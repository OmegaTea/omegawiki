			&emsp;CoffeeBoi (Real name Ben█████ █████ ██████<sup><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/">[1]</a></sup>) is a famous web designer and color theory expert. Believe it or not, he actually chose the colors for this page himself. Originally believed to be British, it has been confirmed that he is in fact American.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[2]</a></sup>
			<br>
			<h2><u>Early Childhood</u></h2>
			&emsp;CoffeeBoi's earliest memory is at 2 years old, finishing the construction of the exterior of the Burj Khalifa. There was an incident during construction where he fell off but got caught by a really big bird. The bird turned out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bird">Big Bird</a>, famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street">Sesame Street</a> character.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[3]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;As an elementary schooler, CoffeeBoi took the infamous "Young Ben PNG" photo. That same year, he ended up becoming friends with <a href="gbin">gbin</a>, after parachuting down to him from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_Proteus">Model 281 Proteus</a>, which he had set to crash into the school building below. After gbin critiqued his form, they later ended up crashing another into the abandoned right wing of the school.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[4]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;His middle school memories before the eighth grade have been completely wiped, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19</a> hitting a vital nerve in the memory of those years.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[5]</a></sup> In the eighth grade, CoffeeBoi (at the time known as BritainBoi) met <a href="omegatea">omegatea</a>, conversing for the first time after several months of beating omegatea to a pulp after spanish class.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[6]</a></sup>
			<h2><u>High School and Drug Addiction</u></h2>
			&emsp;Near the beginning of high school, CoffeeBoi began getting immensely addicted to the Schedule I drug known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello">Cello</a>. He had a short burst of addiction to Coffee, but after going through intense rehab sessions, he has managed to bring it down to a level of casual enjoyment.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[7]</a></sup>
			<br>
			&emsp;CoffeeBoi's high school career could be described with the phrase "fell off", since he did literally nothing throught the entirety of his high school career.
			<br>
			&emsp;CoffeeBoi graduated High School with a 1.0 gpa.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[8]</a></sup>

			<h2><u>Personal Life</u></h2>
			&emsp;CoffeeBoi researches color theory in his free time, and often applies his knowledge on web design. He enjoys spending his free time playing the Cello and playing video games such as games from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing">Animal Crossing</a> series as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid">Metroid</a> series.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[9]</a></sup> It should be noted that in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, CoffeeBoi created an orchard in which villagers would often wander off to and die.
			<h2><u>Cloning and Baldness</u></h2>
			&emsp;At some unknown point in time, CoffeeBoi was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning">cloned</a>.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[10]</a></sup> This resulted in two "Benny"s, each with very contrasting personalities. One Benny shaved his head <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss">shiny bald</a>, earning him the nickname "Bald Benny." The other Benny, known as "Haired Benny," was trapped by Bald Benny in his basement for years.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[11]</a></sup> Bald Benny, the clone of Haired Benny, would end up as a comically evil character.
			<h2><u>Evil Bald Benny</u></h2>
			&emsp;Much of Bald Benny's evil hijinks remained undocumented, though many notable events have been kept safely by mysterious hacker gort17gort (remind me to make him a wiki page), to be released after Bald Benny is confirmed to be dead, with pictures of his dead body posted publically online in a state that is physically not recoverable from.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[12]</a></sup> As it stands, no such photo has been posted, and the information remains unavailable.
			<h2><u>Bald Benny's Death</u></h2>
			&emsp;Although gort17gort's information has not been released, Bald Benny is presumed to have died in the summer of 2025.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[13]</a></sup> Not much is known about the circumstances surrounding his death, but an unknown party was known to have shouted "OH MY GOD! BENNY IS DEAD! THEY KILLED BALD BENNY!" at the scene.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[14]</a></sup> The cause of death is unknown, but he has been legally declared dead and <sup><font class="teal">as far as we know (be careful out there)</font></sup> has been cremated.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[14]</a></sup> When asked to comment on the scenario, gort17gort responded, "Until I see that sick son of a blcthes [sic] dead corpse on my X homepage I'm not leaking the dam [sic] docs"<sup><a href="../real_sources">[15]</a></sup>
