            "Okay, so, long story. I first heard about this information from the news, obviously since it was related to omegatea I HAD to add it to the wiki. Thing is, this news source? Not exactly the most trustworthy, if you know what I mean. Last time I trusted them my house got raided by goblins and all that was left when I came back were the clothes on my back and a can of corn, half eaten. They even took my plywood. MY PLYWOOD! Anyways, I figured it wouldn't hurt to look into it a bit more. I looked around on the internet, and eventually stumbled across an omegatea forum, which I didn't think existed, but if you look far enough apparently it's a thing? Some people had brought up a seperate news article, and a pretty reputable guy on the site (he had about 13,000 cred points, which seems like a lot) had responded to it and given some sources. I managed to get into contact with him through the site, but he told me I would only get the sources if I could answer his riddles three. I accepted, but failed the third one. I was about to close out of the website and continue my search elsewhere, but he said he felt bad and gave me the sources anyways. I noted them down to put on the website. It's a shame that computer burnt down in the fire (also caused by goblins).",
            "I just made that up.",
            "I saw a guy do this in a toothpaste ad once.",
			"It is known."
