		<p>&emsp;On July 15, 2016, a mysterious force (later determined to be <a href="../people/omegatea">omegatea</a><sup>[Citation needed]</sup>) caused the deaths of four young children and a temporary destruction of about 1 spherical mile of ecosystem. The event took place around █████████, Oklahoma, though effects were observed as far as Michigan.<sup><a href="../real_sources">[1]</a></sup></p>

	<h2><u>Foliage Miscoloration</u></h2>
	<font>&emsp;The foliage miscoloration was an unusual change caused by the incident, at first seeming relatively harmless. Upon closer inspection, researchers found that the leaves were made of non-organic tissue. Over 95% of the foliage was composed of Zircon (48%), Iron (24%), Titanium (22%), and other metals (~1%).<sup><a href="real_sources">[2]</a></sup> The plants were extracted for further testing, clearing out a large area of ecosystem which took around 6 years to repair. The area had traces of radiation for months after the event, though much lower amounts than what was initially expected. Small traces of miscolored foliage were found around North America, notably in Flint, Michigan and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.</font>
